# DraftJs-WYSIWYG
This is a just a simple pseudo CMS that I have written so that it will be easy to add huge content pages to websites such as Terms and Conditions and Services and etc. 
The npm package that I've used are : <br/> DraftJs (<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/draft-js">link</a>)<br/>
                                     react-draft-wysiwyg (<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-draft-wysiwyg">link</a>)
                                     
The Usage is pretty simple. Just use the rich text editor to type in whatever article you want, and the text input below it will show you the raw state of the editor in strigified from.
This Raw state can either be stored in a database (Which is most likely what you'll do) or If it's static content, just copy and paste it in the Data.json file of your Project.
